# Button Implementation Summary

## Problem
Buttons in the chatbot were not displaying properly - they were showing as numbered text options instead of actual interactive buttons.

## Solution
Modified the system to send buttons directly through the WhatsApp provider instead of just returning them as JSON response.

## Changes Made

### 1. Provider Service (providerService.ts)
- Added a `setProvider()` function to store the provider instance
- Already had `sendButtons()` function ready to use
- Provider singleton pattern maintained

### 2. App.ts
- Added code to register the provider in the providerService when initialized
- This makes the provider available throughout the application

### 3. Flow Registry (flowRegistry.ts)
- Modified to accept provider instance through options parameter
- Added provider preservation in state throughout flow execution
- Updated button node handling to send buttons directly through provider when available
- Maintains backward compatibility - falls back to JSON response if provider is not available

### 4. Text API (text.ts)
- Modified to get the provider instance from providerService
- Passes the provider through to processFlowMessage in options
- Provider is then available in the flow state for button sending

## Technical Details

When a button node is encountered:
1. The system checks if a provider is available in the state
2. If available, it calls `provider.sendButtons()` directly
3. Buttons are sent to WhatsApp with proper formatting
4. If provider is not available, falls back to the old JSON response method

Button format for provider:
```javascript
await provider.sendButtons(
  userPhoneNumber,
  messageText,
  [
    { body: "Option 1", id: "handle-0" },
    { body: "Option 2", id: "handle-1" }
  ]
);
```

## Testing
Created a test script at `test-buttons.sh` to verify the implementation.

## Notes
- Provider is preserved throughout the flow state
- Button handling supports both direct provider sending and JSON response as fallback
- Fully backward compatible with existing implementations
